Hey I am building a travel agency website, that's named "SamayaOdyssey".
Help me build its frontend part, with compelete nav bars, hero section, main body that contains infos about tour package, and each tap on package leads to a 
different page that explains the itenary with visuals that is to used from the images I have provided in the images folder.
This website takes user info like name, email, phone number, tour package name, number of persons in a modern looking form. This data is sent to the backend for it to be save in a 
Db.

The tech stack that is to be used for frontend is React js, make this website responsive for both large screens and mobile screen, a ham burger icon is to be used to hold the navbar options in the mobile device.
